All trigBoards after this date will be burned with this code
- Fixed a minor bug in the RTC init tab
- Fixed an issue where the battery threshold wasn't saving
- Changed the code directory a little bit for OTA/USB programming of the bin files
- Pretty big change was to use an event handler to detect when the WiFi connection is established - both on WiFi and UDP tabs
